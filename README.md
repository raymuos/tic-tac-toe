# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game, where you can:
1. go back in time to change a move
2. reset the board mid-game
3. toggle between DumBot mode and 2Player mode
4. The bot uses Minimax Algorithm, so it's virtually impossible to beat the bot.

Made with React and TailwindCSS

(P.S. - Please don't play alone, its sad to play a 2-player game by yourself, and you can't beat the bot anyways)
